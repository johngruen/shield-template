Mozilla wants to know if having a Firefox experience tailored to the way you use the internet makes browsing the web more enjoyable. Participating in this study will help us find out!

## What will happen next

**If you agree** to participate:

1. We install **Firefox Guide**, an add-on that will make the Firefox browser more personal to your usage patterns.
2. Continue using Firefox as you normally would. After a few days, you might see notifications about Firefox features.
3. After 30 days, the study will end on its own. Your Firefox will go back to normal.
4. We will ask you to fill out a quick **optional survey** to tell us about your experience. The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.

## Leaving the study

The study will expire on its own in 30 days.  You may leave the study early.  To do so, follow these steps:

1. Type `about:addons` into the location bar, and press enter.
2. Find `Firefox Guide Study 1` in the **extensions** list pane.
3. Click the `remove` button.
4. If you opt out of the study early we will ask you to fill out a survey. We’re interested in hearing about your experience, even if you didn’t participate in the entire study.

Opting out of a study does not prevent you from participating in future studies.

## Your privacy

Our studies collect a basic set of data, such as your daily usage, information about when you install or uninstall the addon, and your responses to optional follow-up surveys.

In addition, here are the **key things you should know** about what is happening when you participate in this study:

- **We collect basic usage data** about your interaction with the experimental add-on, such as how you interact with the recommendations we make.
- **We collect data on what Firefox features you use**, to provide a personalized Firefox experience. This includes your installed add-ons, preferences, and keyboard shortcuts.
- We also recommend features to you based on popular websites you visit. **Your browsing data remains on your computer** and will not be collected on our servers.
